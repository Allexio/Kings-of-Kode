# About King of Kode

![our app in action][game-screenshot]

## Rules

This game is played against 3 AI enemies, and the goal is to win either by killing all of them, or by gaining 20 points.
This is done by rolling 6 dice every turn.
These dice are tap-able, which allows you to select some to re-throw up to two times per turn.
Once you have thrown (and re-thrown) your dice, the enemies do the same.
There are 6 die faces. 3 that let you score points, one that lets you attack enemies, one that heals you (when you are not the Kode King) and one that gives you research points to unlock power cards with.
Every other rule can be gleaned from the official King of Tokyo manual [here](https://www.iello.com/sites/default/files/2016-10/KingOfTokyo_2016_EN_Rules.pdf).

## Built With

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Material](https://material.io/)

## Usage

Our game is fully functional.
All you need to do is download the files from Git and build the APK.
One aspect we would have liked to work on more is the AI as we currently have a pretty barebones one.
